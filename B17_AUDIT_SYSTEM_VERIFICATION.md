# B17 - Audit Trail & Events System Verification

## ✅ Implementation Complete

**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and tested  
**Test Results**: 16/16 tests passing  

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Domain Events + Outbox Pattern
- **Domain Events Table**: `domain_events` - stores all business events with metadata
- **Outbox Table**: `outbox` - reliable webhook delivery pattern with retry logic
- **Audit Log Table**: `audit_log` - human-readable audit trail for admin actions

### Event Types Implemented
1. `SLOTS_BULK_CREATED` - When admin creates multiple slots at once
2. `SLOT_UPDATED` - When individual slots are modified (capacity, notes)
3. `SLOTS_BLACKED_OUT` - Special handling for blackout operations
4. `TEMPLATE_APPLIED` - When admin applies slot templates to date ranges
5. `BOOKING_UPDATED` - When bookings are modified or cancelled

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### AuditService (`/server/services/audit.ts`)
```typescript
// Combined domain event + audit logging
await AuditService.emitAdminEvent(
  context,
  eventType,
  aggregateId,
  aggregateType,
  eventData,
  auditAction,
  auditSummary
);
```

### Route Integration
All admin mutation endpoints now emit audit events:
- `POST /api/slots/bulk` - Bulk slot creation
- `PATCH /api/slots/:id` - Slot updates/blackouts
- `POST /v1/slots/apply-template` - Template application
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` - Booking cancellation

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Domain Events for event sourcing
domain_events (id, tenant_id, event_type, aggregate_id, aggregate_type, event_data, actor_id, actor_type, created_at)

-- Outbox Pattern for reliable webhook delivery
outbox (id, event_id, tenant_id, event_type, payload, status, processed_at, retry_count, created_at)

-- Audit Log for human-readable trail
audit_log (id, tenant_id, actor_id, actor_type, action, resource_type, resource_id, payload_summary, event_id, created_at)
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage (16/16 passing)

### Domain Event Tests
- ✅ Event emission with proper metadata
- ✅ Outbox entry creation for reliable delivery
- ✅ JSON payload serialization and validation

### Audit Logging Tests  
- ✅ Human-readable audit log creation
- ✅ Actor and resource tracking
- ✅ Event linking between tables

### Admin Action Coverage
- ✅ Bulk slot creation events
- ✅ Individual slot updates
- ✅ Blackout operations (special event type)
- ✅ Template application events
- ✅ Booking cancellation events

### Error Handling
- ✅ Domain event failures propagate correctly
- ✅ Audit log failures don't break main flow
- ✅ Complex payload serialization

## 🎯 Business Value

### Compliance & Audit Trail
- Complete audit trail for all admin actions
- Actor tracking (who did what, when)
- Resource change history with before/after states

### Integration Ready
- Outbox pattern enables reliable webhook delivery
- Event sourcing foundation for future event replay
- JSON payloads ready for external system consumption

### Operational Insights
- Admin action monitoring and analytics
- Pattern detection for optimization
- Historical change tracking for debugging

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Run audit system tests
npx vitest run server/__tests__/admin_audit_events.spec.ts

# Test output shows all events working:
# ✅ SLOTS_BULK_CREATED domain event
# ✅ SLOT_UPDATED domain event  
# ✅ SLOTS_BLACKED_OUT domain event
# ✅ TEMPLATE_APPLIED domain event
# ✅ BOOKING_UPDATED domain event
```

## 🏁 Completion Status

**B17 - Audit Trail & Events System**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

All admin actions now emit domain events and create audit log entries. The system is ready for production use and future integration requirements.

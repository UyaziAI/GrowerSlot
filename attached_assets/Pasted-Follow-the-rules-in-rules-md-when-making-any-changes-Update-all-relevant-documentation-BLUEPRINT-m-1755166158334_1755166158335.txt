Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update all relevant documentation (BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md) as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in BLUEPRINT.md for every change.

Goal: Replace the current week view’s “hourly calendar” layout with a grid of 7 day cards that show summary availability and allow clicking into Day view. This aligns with the updated Week Overview UX plan.

Context & Files

Frontend: /app/frontend/src/features/booking/

Current week view = vertical hours × days; requirement is to replace with a day-card grid per Section 7 of Blueprint.md and the UX plan.

Clicking a day card should navigate to Day view (view=day&date=YYYY-MM-DD).

Data fetched from /v1/slots?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD.

Required Changes

Component structure

Create <WeekOverviewGrid /> and <DayCard /> components in booking/.

<WeekOverviewGrid />:

Accepts anchorDate (start of 7-day range) and onSelectDate.

Fetches slot data for the week in one API call.

Aggregates per day: total slots, total capacity, booked, remaining, utilization %.

Passes summaries to <DayCard />.

<DayCard />:

Shows weekday, date, availability badge, quick facts (slots, earliest time, restrictions, blackout, notes).

Badge colors: Green ≥50% remaining, Amber 20–49%, Red <20%, Grey = no capacity/blackout.

On click: calls onSelectDate(date) → navigates to Day view.

Layout & responsiveness

Desktop: 7 columns, 1 row.

Tablet: 3–4 columns, multiple rows.

Mobile: 2 columns, scrollable.

Tailwind grid classes for responsiveness.

Navigation

Integrate into existing calendar page; header retains Prev/Next Week, Today, view toggle.

On day card click, update URL params ?view=day&date=... and render existing Day view.

Data fetching & performance

Prefer GET /v1/slots?start=&end=; if unsupported, fallback to 7 parallel calls.

Prefetch Day view data on hover/focus (desktop) or tap (mobile) to speed navigation.

Accessibility

Each card is a focusable button with aria-label summarizing date and availability.

Tooltips for notes/restrictions are keyboard accessible.

Testing

Unit: aggregation logic, color thresholds, click handler.

E2E: week→day transition, date alignment, responsive layout.

Docs

Update BLUEPRINT.md Section 7 to describe the new Week Overview design.

Move “Week view calendar” in FEATURES.md from “Known Gaps” to “Implemented”.

Add changelog entry in BLUEPRINT.md.

Acceptance Criteria

Week view shows day cards (no hourly grid).

Data accurate and color thresholds applied.

Click navigates to detailed Day view.

Works on mobile/desktop; passes all tests.

Pinpoint & fix unauthenticated Admin calls using logs

Issue
Access-token errors persist. Logs show unauthenticated Admin requests (e.g., GET /v1/slots 401 with auth_reason:"missing_or_invalid_token"). We need to identify the exact call path(s) and eliminate them.

Intended outcomes

Use current dev logging to capture, for every Admin API call, a pinpoint context line that includes: request_id, endpoint, method, source (component/hook/action), and a gating snapshot (e.g., tokenPresent, authReady, enabled, and any relevant UI state like sheetOpen?).

Produce a short Root-cause note listing the specific call site(s) that fired without auth (example request_ids, endpoint(s), and triggering UI/actions).

Apply the smallest fix so no Admin requests can fire without the expected auth from first paint onward (including initial load, view switches, drawers/sheets, bulk actions, exports/prefetch).

Add a tripwire check that fails if any unauthenticated Admin request occurs again.

Constraints & guardrails

Smallest safe diff; no UI redesign; no new endpoints.

Use /v1 APIs; respect feature flags (defaults).

Do not fabricate data; keep 422/403/409 messages verbatim in the UI.

Do not add a refresh-token flow unless one already exists.

Definition of Done

Logging shows one clear context line per Admin API call (with source and gating snapshot) and correlates with server logs via request_id.

The Root-cause note cites exact offending call site(s) and what was wrong in their gating/headers.

After the fix, normal Admin flows generate no unauthenticated calls and no access-token popups; a deliberate unauthenticated call triggers the tripwire and fails with a clear message.

Update docs to truth: mark the auth item ✅ in ADMIN_STATUS_REPORT.md with the root-cause note and example request_ids; add a brief Delta in BLUEPRINT.md; add an Unreleased entry in CHANGELOG.md (adjust any prior overstatements).

Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update all relevant documentation (BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md, CHANGELOG.md) as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md (and Blueprint’s Delta) for every change.

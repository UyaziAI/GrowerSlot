Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. For this task, do not modify any files and do not create new files. This is a read‑only diagnostic: print code and output a structured report only.

Goal (read‑only)

Produce a complete, human‑readable report showing how the Day Timeline scroller is built and why the center (selected) pill may appear clipped/top‑bottom or have uneven vertical padding.

Absolutely no edits/commits to the codebase; only print and analyze.

0) Exact files to PRINT verbatim (with file path headings)

app/frontend/src/features/booking/DayTimeline.tsx

app/frontend/src/features/booking/DayPill.tsx

app/frontend/src/features/booking/DayTimeline.css (if exists)

Where the timeline is rendered (choose all that apply and print):

app/frontend/src/pages/BookingPage.tsx

app/frontend/src/features/booking/BookingPage.tsx

app/frontend/src/App.tsx (if it wires the page)

UI shells that may set overflow/padding:

app/frontend/src/components/ui/card.tsx and/or .../card.ts (if using shadcn)

Any local ScrollArea wrapper components (e.g. app/frontend/src/components/scroll-area/*.tsx)

Tailwind config, if custom plugins might affect sizing:

app/frontend/tailwind.config.*

Print each file as:

--- BEGIN <relative/path> ---
<file contents>
--- END <relative/path> ---

1) Repo SEARCH (print matches with 3 lines of context)

Search the frontend for these patterns and print results using the same BEGIN/END framing:

overflow-hidden

overflow-y-

ScrollArea.Viewport OR Viewport

scale- OR transform: scale

motion OR framer (possible animated scale)

snap- (snap-x, snap-mandatory, snap-center)

min-h-[ and h-[ (explicit heights)

py- (lane/pill vertical padding)

ring- OR focus-visible:ring

Format each block as:

--- BEGIN SEARCH:<pattern> ---
<path>:<lineNo>  <matched line>
  <-3,+3 lines of context if available->
--- END SEARCH:<pattern> ---

2) Static analysis (write a clear, structured REPORT)

After printing the files and search results, output a “Timeline Construction Report” with these sections:

A. Component & DOM structure

Identify the component that renders the row of pills (the “lane”).

List the ancestor chain (from the lane up to the Card/container) and note any overflow styles on each ancestor (especially overflow: hidden).

B. Sizing & spacing

For the lane: list the applied classes/props controlling vertical size (py-*, min-h-*, h-*, items-center, etc.).

For the selected pill vs non‑selected pill: list the classes that change padding, font size/weight, border/ring, and any transform/scale.

C. Scrolling & centering

Confirm how centering is achieved: snap-x/snap-mandatory on lane and snap-center on pills vs scrollIntoView({ inline: 'center' }).

Note any CSS that could fight centering (e.g., fixed heights, sticky parents).

D. Likely clipping causes (ranked)

Based on the printed code, rank the top 3 probable causes of vertical clipping or uneven top/bottom padding (examples: ancestor overflow: hidden, Radix ScrollArea.Viewport default overflow, transform scale on the selected pill, insufficient lane min-h, focus ring thickness exceeding lane height, etc.).

For each cause, reference the exact file + line(s) from the printed code/search that support the finding.

E. Measurements to verify (no code changes)

Provide a short DevTools snippet the user can run at runtime (in the browser console) to log getComputedStyle of the selected pill and its lane for: height, padding-top, padding-bottom, line-height, border-width, and any transform.

Include a one‑liner to walk up the DOM from the selected pill and log any ancestor where overflow-y is not visible.

F. Conclusion

Summarize which file(s)/class(es) most likely cause the clipping as‑is, and whether the issue is overflow chain, transform scaling, or insufficient lane height/padding mismatch.

Important: This REPORT is analysis only. Do not modify files or propose diffs inside this run.

3) Output order

All requested files (Section 0)

All search results (Section 1)

The structured Timeline Construction Report (Section 2)

End with:
=== END OF READ-ONLY TIMELINE REPORT ===

4) Safety rails

Do not write/format code changes.

Do not create temporary test files.

Do not edit Tailwind or component files.

This is a print & analyze only task.

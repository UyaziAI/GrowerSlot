Fix runtime error + access token noise in Admin

Issue
A runtime error keeps appearing in-screen and coincides with access-token noise:

[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] isOpen is not defined
.../src/pages/DayEditorSheet.tsx:83:14
81 |        };
82 |      },
83 |      enabled: isOpen
   |               ^
84 |    });


We need to eliminate this error and any related unauthenticated calls it may cause.

Intended outcomes

The isOpen is not defined error is removed; Day Editor opens/closes without runtime errors.

Any data fetching in the Day Editor is properly gated by valid, defined conditions (e.g., sheet visibility and auth readiness), so it never fires when closed or unauthenticated.

Admin requests from the Day Editor (and related flows it triggers) include the expected authentication and do not produce “Access token required” popups.

Dev console logs (frontend) and server logs show no missing-auth events for Day Editor interactions.

Constraints & guardrails

Smallest safe diff; no UI redesign; no new endpoints.

Use /v1 APIs; respect feature flags; no fabricated data.

Keep other server errors (422/403/409) verbatim in the UI.

Do not add a refresh-token flow unless one already exists.

Definition of Done

Build runs cleanly (no isOpen runtime error); opening/closing the Day Editor does not throw.

Network checks while opening the Day Editor show no unauthenticated calls; requests are gated until prerequisites are ready; no “Access token required” popup appears.

Logs confirm no admin_request_missing_auth (or equivalent) during Day Editor usage.

Documentation to truth: update ADMIN_STATUS_REPORT.md (note the root cause and fix, mark item ✅ with brief evidence), add a small Delta note in BLUEPRINT.md, and add an Unreleased entry in CHANGELOG.md.

Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update all relevant documentation (BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md, CHANGELOG.md) as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md (and Blueprint’s Delta) for every change.

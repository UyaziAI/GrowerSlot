Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update all relevant documentation (BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md) as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in BLUEPRINT.md for every change.

Context (files):

src/pages/AdminPage.tsx (replace)

src/pages/DayPeekSheet.tsx, src/pages/DayEditorSheet.tsx, src/pages/BulkBar.tsx, src/pages/SlotSheet.tsx (create by copying content from app/frontend/src/pages/*)

src/App.tsx (route prop consistency)

Changes:

Routes (wouter): In src/App.tsx, use component={AdminPage} for /admin (replace any element={<AdminPage />} usage). Also keep / and /dashboard mapping admins to AdminPage.

Move components into the active tree: Copy these files from app/frontend/src/pages/ to src/pages/: DayPeekSheet.tsx, DayEditorSheet.tsx, BulkBar.tsx, SlotSheet.tsx. (Do not rename exports.)

Replace src/pages/AdminPage.tsx with the reconciled calendar implementation that:

Keeps header buttons with data-testid="admin-header-create" and data-testid="admin-header-more".

Renders Month (42 cells), Week (7 cols), Day (vertical list).

Click day → opens DayPeekSheet; “Edit Day” → DayEditorSheet; selection mode → BulkBar.

Day view slot click → SlotSheet.

Networking: fetch slots with GET /v1/slots?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD (per blueprint), show json.error verbatim on non-OK (esp. 422), and refetch after mutations.

Validation: all create/blackout dialogs must block past dates (Africa/Johannesburg) and surface the server message verbatim.

Root <div> must include data-testid="admin-page".

Docs:

BLUEPRINT.md changelog: “FE reconcile — Admin wired in /src, routes unified to component prop, calendar views and day sheets integrated.”

FEATURES.md: mark “Admin calendar core UX (Month/Week/Day + Peek/Editor/Bulk)” as Implemented (V1) for the /src app.

ISSUES.md: add follow-ups: data badges, inspector polish, virtualization, template drawer (flagged).

Acceptance:

Visiting /admin shows an “Admin Calendar” with 42 day cells and opens DayPeekSheet on click.

/, /dashboard show the same Admin UI when authService.isAdmin() is true.

No Grower-specific components appear on /admin.

GET /v1/slots?start&end is used (not /v1/slots/range).

All errors render json.error text (no generic “Internal Server Error”).

Safety checks (fail if not true):

If any of the four components are missing in app/frontend/src/pages, abort and write reports/admin_reconcile_blockers.md listing the missing files.

Do not touch client/** or app/frontend/** beyond reading source files to copy.

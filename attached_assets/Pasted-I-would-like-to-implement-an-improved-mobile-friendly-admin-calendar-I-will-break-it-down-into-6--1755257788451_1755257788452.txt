I would like to implement an improved (mobile-friendly) admin calendar. I will break it down into 6 bite-size tasks (M1 - M6).

M1 — Toolbar cleanup + DayPeek bottom sheet

Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in BLUEPRINT.md for every change.

Goal: Simplify the header and add a mobile-first Day Peek bottom sheet. Remove global Blackout/Restrictions buttons (they will live in context).

Files (create/update only these):

/app/frontend/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx

/app/frontend/src/pages/DayPeekSheet.tsx (new)

/app/frontend/src/pages/FilterDrawer.tsx (new)

Tests: /app/frontend/src/__tests__/admin_ui_m1.spec.tsx

Implementation (do exactly this):

Toolbar (AdminPage):

Left: Segmented control Month | Week | Day.

Center: Date nav ‹ › | Today | Date picker.

Right: Create ▾ and More ▾ only. Move Export CSV into More ▾. Remove Blackout and Apply Restrictions from header.

Move filters into a FilterDrawer opened by an icon button in the toolbar.

DayPeekSheet.tsx (bottom sheet component):

Props: { dateISO: string, summary: {remaining:number, booked:number, blackout:boolean, restricted:boolean}, onCreateDay:()=>void, onBlackoutDay:()=>void, onRestrictDay:()=>void, onOpenEditor:()=>void, onOpenDayView:()=>void }.

Renders: date title, chips (Remaining/Booked, ⛔ Blackout, 🔒 Restricted), buttons: Create Slots — Day, Blackout Day, Restrict Day, links: Open Day view, Edit Day.

AdminPage wiring: single-tap on a day opens DayPeekSheet with real summary from API; double-tap not required.

Tests (admin_ui_m1.spec.tsx):

Header shows only Create ▾ and More ▾ on the right.

Tapping a day opens DayPeekSheet with date + buttons.

Export is present inside More ▾.

Docs:

BLUEPRINT.md §7 Frontend Plan: add Day Peek bottom sheet + toolbar simplification; state Blackout/Restrictions moved to context.

FEATURES.md: mark “Header cleanup + Day Peek” as In-Progress → Implemented when test passes.

Acceptance: Header reduced; DayPeekSheet opens on tap; tests pass

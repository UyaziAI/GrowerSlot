Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update all relevant documentation (BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md) as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in BLUEPRINT.md for every change.

Context

A new file exists at the repo root: ./Admin_Addendum.md. This document augments the Admin experience with templates, preview/publish, no UI fabrication, and Month/Week/Day admin calendar behavior.

This task is documentation-only (no app code).

Goals

Incorporate the addendum into the canonical blueprint with zero duplication/conflicts.

Record status in tracking files per governance.

Tasks

Blueprint delta (no duplication):

Open Blueprint.md. Add a new section near the end titled “Admin Addendum (15 Aug 2025) — Delta” that:

Links to ./Admin_Addendum.md.

Summarizes only the differences/additions vs the current blueprint:

Frontend Plan (§7): Admin Calendar Month/Week/Day, right-hand Inspector, Preview & Publish, no client-side fabrication rule, Next Available finder.

API (§6): add PATCH /v1/bookings/{id}, template CRUD, and POST /v1/slots/apply-template (preview/publish, idempotent).

Data Model (§4): new templates table (and optional template_runs).

Testing (§11): add tests for template apply (preview vs publish idempotency), no-fabrication guarantees, admin drag-drop with 403/409 behavior.

Security/Tenancy (§8): clarify RBAC for admin routes and template ops.

Do not restate existing content; keep the delta concise (bullet list).

Cross-link: In Blueprint.md’s table of contents (if present), add an entry that points to the new Delta section, and add a link at the top “See also: Admin_Addendum.md”.

FEATURES.md:

Add the following to In-Progress: “Admin full calendar (Month/Week/Day)”, “Templates + Apply Template”, “Next Available finder”.

Move “Week view calendar” from Gaps to In-Progress (leave as Implemented only after code PR passes tests).

ISSUES.md:

Create a new issue: “Adopt Admin Addendum (docs phase)” with acceptance criteria:

Blueprint.md Delta added + cross-links.

FEATURES.md and ISSUES.md updated.

Changelog entry appended.

Add two follow-up issues (status: Open):

“Implement Templates & Apply-Template endpoints + UI (feature-flagged)”

“Wire Admin calendar to /v1 only; remove UI fabrication; add tests”

Changelog: Append to the Blueprint.md changelog: date, author, and a single line: “Admin Addendum adopted (docs-only); code rollout in next PR behind flags.”

Constraints

Do not modify any code files in this task.

Preserve v1 API backward compatibility.

Avoid duplicate sections; use Delta bullets + cross-links instead.

Outputs

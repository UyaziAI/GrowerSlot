Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update all relevant documentation (BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md) as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in BLUEPRINT.md for every change.

Goal: Perform a full codebase scan, quarantine legacy UI, standardize the Admin route and endpoints, and generate a comprehensive status report cross-referencing BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, and ISSUES.md.

Scope (do exactly these, in order)

Create a safety branch & report folder

Create branch fix/admin-cleanup-001.

Ensure reports/ exists.

Determine active frontend root & build scripts

If both client/ and app/frontend/ exist, set active to app/frontend/.

Update package.json scripts to build/start from app/frontend. Do not delete client/ yet.

Consolidate /admin routing

In app/frontend/src/App.tsx (or router), ensure:

import AdminPage from './pages/AdminPage';
<Route path="/admin" element={<AdminPage />} />


Remove any other /admin routes or aliases.

Ensure AdminPage.tsx does not import Grower components (no features/booking, GrowerTimeline, etc.).

Quarantine legacy Admin/Grower components

Find files matching: Admin(Dashboard|Calendar|Page|View).*.(tsx|jsx), or any client/src/**/admin*.

If not referenced by the active router after step 3, move them to legacy/quarantined/<timestamp>/ preserving paths. Do not delete.

Update any imports that still point at quarantined files to the active equivalents in app/frontend/src/pages/.

Endpoint path scrub (FE only)

In app/frontend/**, replace "/api/" with "/v1/" for all HTTP calls.

Do not touch backend paths in this step.

Feature flags

Verify .env.example contains:

VITE_FEATURE_ADMIN_TEMPLATES=false
VITE_FEATURE_NEXT_AVAILABLE=false


Ensure these flags gate the corresponding UI.

Build & test

Run FE build and FE tests; run BE tests if present. Record failures but proceed to report.

Generate report files (must be created):

reports/admin_status.md (human summary) and reports/admin_status.json (machine-readable) containing:

Router mapping: file(s) that define /admin, the exact component path rendered.

Header check: confirm only Create ▾ and More ▾ render in the Admin header (no top-level Blackout/Restrictions/Export/Apply Template buttons).

Day interactions presence: whether DayPeekSheet, DayEditorSheet, BulkBar, and SlotSheet are imported and used.

Endpoint usage: list all remaining "/api/" occurrences (file:line) after scrub.

Legacy quarantine list: all files moved to legacy/quarantined/....

Docs cross-ref: summarize mismatches vs BLUEPRINT.md (Admin Delta/API), FEATURES.md (status for Admin Calendar, Templates, Next Available), ISSUES.md (open items referencing Admin).

Build/test summary: pass/fail counts and first 20 lines of any failure per suite.

Top 10 fixes (actionable): each with file:line and one-line instruction.

Docs updates

BLUEPRINT.md changelog: “Admin cleanup pass #001 — routes consolidated, legacy quarantined, FE endpoints moved to /v1; status report generated.”

If any Admin feature was found missing/disabled, add a short note under the Blueprint Delta.

Update ISSUES.md with a new issue “Admin cleanup #001 follow-ups” summarizing the Top 10 fixes from the report (checkbox list).

Acceptance

/admin renders app/frontend/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx only.

reports/admin_status.md and reports/admin_status.json exist and include: router mapping, header check, component usage, endpoint list, quarantined files, docs cross-ref, build/test summary, and Top-10 fixes.

No client/src Admin routes are active.

No "/api/" strings remain in app/frontend/**.

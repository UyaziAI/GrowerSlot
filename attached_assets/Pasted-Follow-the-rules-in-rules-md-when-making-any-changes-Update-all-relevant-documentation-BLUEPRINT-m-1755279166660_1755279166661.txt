Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update all relevant documentation (BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md) as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in BLUEPRINT.md for every change.

Goal
Create a precise, evidence-based status audit of the Admin interface vs the Admin Addendum (v1.1) and the Unified Blueprint, then update repository docs accordingly‚Äîwithout introducing new functionality.

Scope (read + report; docs may be edited, app code must not change)
- Frontend (read-only for this task):
  /app/frontend/src/pages/AdminPage.tsx
  /app/frontend/src/pages/DayPeekSheet.tsx
  /app/frontend/src/pages/DayEditorSheet.tsx
  /app/frontend/src/pages/SlotSheet.tsx
  /app/frontend/src/pages/BulkBar.tsx
  /app/frontend/src/pages/CreateSlotsDialog.tsx
  /app/frontend/src/pages/BulkCreateDialog.tsx
  /app/frontend/src/features/booking/components/* (CalendarMonth, WeekOverviewGrid, DayTimeline, etc.)
  /app/frontend/src/api/endpoints.ts
- Backend (read-only for this task):
  /app/backend/routers/{slots.py,bookings.py,restrictions.py,exports.py}
  /app/backend/schemas.py
  /app/backend/services/templates.py
  /app/backend/tests/*
- Docs (these MAY be edited by this task):
  Admin_Addendum.md, Blueprint.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md, CHANGELOG.md, RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md

What to produce (files to create/update)
1) Create /docs/ADMIN_STATUS_REPORT.md with the structure below.
2) Update Blueprint.md (Delta + Testing + API sections) with any factual adjustments discovered.
3) Update FEATURES.md (move items between Implemented / In-Progress, fix locations/paths if drifted).
4) Update ISSUES.md (close resolved items, add precise new gaps with acceptance criteria if discovered).
5) Update CHANGELOG.md (Unreleased) with a dated line summarizing this audit + doc sync.
6) Do NOT modify application logic or tests in this task.

Method (how to audit)
- Cross-check the Admin Addendum v1.1 acceptance criteria and UI architecture against the actual code/tests.
- Verify endpoints used are /v1 only; confirm no legacy /api calls remain.
- Confirm client validations (min=today with Africa/Johannesburg), verbatim 4xx error surfacing (422/403/409).
- Confirm ‚Äúno fabrication‚Äù rule: calendar renders only backend data (no placeholders/phantom slots).
- Verify feature flags exist and defaults: VITE_FEATURE_ADMIN_TEMPLATES=false, VITE_FEATURE_NEXT_AVAILABLE=false.
- Confirm audit/events emission paths are still invoked by admin mutations.
- Inspect test coverage that proves the above (unit, integration, E2E). Record what exists and what‚Äôs missing.

Acceptance criteria for this task (the report is DONE when all pass)
- ADMIN_STATUS_REPORT.md clearly lists: (A) What works now, (B) Still to do, (C) Known risks/edge cases, (D) Test coverage map, (E) API/flags compliance, (F) Knock-on effects.
- All statements in the report cite specific files/lines/functions or test names.
- Docs are updated to reflect reality (no future tense for already-shipped items; no stale paths).
- No application code behavior changes.

ADMIN_STATUS_REPORT.md ‚Äî required outline
# Admin Page Status ‚Äî Audit (YYYY-MM-DD)
1) Summary
   - One-paragraph executive summary of current Admin capabilities and gaps.
2) UI Views & Interactions (spec vs. implementation)
   - Toolbar (Month|Week|Day; Create ‚ñæ; More ‚ñæ)
   - Month view (42 cells, badges, ‚õî, üîí)
   - Week view (7 columns, real slot ribbons only)
   - Day view (timeline / draw-to-create desktop; FAB on mobile)
   - Day Peek (actions + links)
   - Day Editor (Overview, Quick create, Restrictions, Utilities)
   - Selection mode + Bulk bar (Month/Week only)
   - Slot sheet (Day view)
   For each bullet: ‚úÖ working | ‚ö†Ô∏è partial | ‚ùå missing, with evidence (files/tests).
3) Validation & Integrity
   - Past date blocking (AJ timezone), capacity > 0, slot_length_min 1..1440, ISO weekdays 1..7
   - Verbatim error surfacing (422/403/409)
   - No-fabrication guarantee (render only GET /v1/slots* data)
   - Blackout behavior (booking on blacked-out returns 409)
4) API & Flags Compliance
   - All Admin UI calls use /v1 endpoints; list any stragglers
   - Feature flags present + defaults; where referenced in code
5) Events & Audit
   - Which admin flows emit events/audit logs; include emitting function names & tests
6) Accessibility & Mobile
   - A11y labels on day cells, 44√ó44 targets, bottom sheet behavior; list tests covering this
7) Test Coverage Map
   - Unit: components/validators
   - Integration: backend validators, blackout, bookings PATCH
   - E2E: core admin flows; include spec file names
   - Gaps: list missing tests that would prove acceptance criteria
8) What‚Äôs Left To Do (actionable backlog)
   - Concrete, spec-worded items tied to Addendum acceptance criteria (e.g., ‚ÄúMonth renders 42 cells‚Äù)
   - Any missing dialogs/edge behaviors
9) Knock-On Effects (update plan)
   - Forms & validation, API hooks/cache keys, eventing/audit, analytics chips, feature flags
10) Recommendations / Next Steps
   - Ordered, low-risk changes to close gaps with suggested test additions

Documentation edits to make (after the audit step)
- Blueprint.md
  - Update the ‚ÄúAdmin Addendum ‚Äî Delta‚Äù section to reflect which items are DONE vs NEXT, and note any deviations discovered. Add a new dated entry in the Blueprint changelog describing this audit + doc sync.
- FEATURES.md
  - Move Admin items to the correct status buckets based on findings. Ensure file paths reference FastAPI/React structure and /v1 endpoints.
- ISSUES.md
  - Close items proven complete; add new issues for any gaps with acceptance criteria + minimal repro notes.
- CHANGELOG.md
  - Under [Unreleased], add ‚ÄúDocs: Admin audit + synchronization pass ‚Äî updated Blueprint Delta, FEATURES status, ISSUES, and CHANGELOG.‚Äù

Formatting & rigor
- Use concise bullets; cite exact files/tests for each claim.
- Do not speculate‚Äîif unsure, mark as ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù with a TODO to verify, or add an ISSUES.md item.
- Preserve existing doc tone/structure; do not rename sections without necessity.
- Keep v1 API backward compatibility; do not propose breaking changes.

Knock-On Effect Rule (must check and report explicitly)
- Related modals/forms & validation
- API dependencies and TanStack Query keys
- Supply chain workflows (if impacted by admin changes)
- Event logging, analytics chips, and feature flags

Expected outputs (commit artifacts)
- /docs/ADMIN_STATUS_REPORT.md (new)
- Updated: Blueprint.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md, CHANGELOG.md

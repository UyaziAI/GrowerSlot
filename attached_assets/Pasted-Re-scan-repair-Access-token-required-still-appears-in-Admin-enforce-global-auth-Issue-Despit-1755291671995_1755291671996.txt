Re-scan & repair: “Access token required” still appears in Admin (enforce global auth)

Issue
Despite a prior “fixed” report, the “Access token required” popup still appears while using the Admin area when logged in.

Intended outcomes

Reproduce the issue and produce an automated failing check that captures the popup or an unauthenticated Admin call, then make it pass.

Enforce a single global auth path so every Admin request uses the expected authentication (headers/cookies) from the first request onward.

Gate all Admin requests until auth context is ready (initial load, view switches, drawers/sheets, bulk actions, exports, and any background/prefetch).

On missing/expired auth, handle cleanly (e.g., redirect) without showing this popup; keep other server errors (422/403/409) verbatim.

Provide evidence (before/after network traces or test output) that the popup cannot be triggered and no unauthenticated Admin calls occur.

Constraints & guardrails

Smallest safe diff; no UI redesign; no new endpoints.

Use /v1 APIs; respect feature flags (defaults).

No fabricated data; do not weaken verbatim server error handling.

Do not introduce a new refresh-token flow unless one already exists.

Definition of Done

An automated check that previously failed (popup/unauthenticated call) now passes.

Dev tools/network confirm no unauthenticated Admin calls across initial load, navigation, sheets, bulk actions, and exports; popup does not appear.

With auth removed/expired, user is redirected cleanly; 422/403/409 still show exact server text.

Update docs to truth: edit ADMIN_STATUS_REPORT.md (mark this item ✅ with concise evidence of what changed and how verified), add a short Delta note in BLUEPRINT.md, and add an Unreleased entry in CHANGELOG.md. If previous entries overstated completion, correct them.

Follow the rules in rules.md when making any changes. Update all relevant documentation (BLUEPRINT.md, FEATURES.md, ISSUES.md, CHANGELOG.md) as required by the rules. Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md (and Blueprint’s Delta) for every change.

✅ API Migration Completed Successfully

Date: August 15, 2025
Task: Complete migration from /api/ to /v1/ route prefixes

Changes Applied:
- All server routes migrated from /api/ to /v1/ prefix
- Frontend query keys updated across client/src and app/frontend directories  
- Health check endpoint now at /v1/health returning correct JSON response
- Authentication routes migrated to /v1/auth/login and /v1/auth/me
- All test suites passing (31/31 tests across audit and export functionality)
- Documentation updated in FEATURES.md to reflect accurate file paths

Verification:
- curl /v1/health returns {"status":"ok"}
- curl /api/health returns 404 (expected)
- All React Query keys updated to /v1/ prefix
- LSP diagnostics resolved for route references
- Test suites: admin_audit_events.spec.ts (16/16) and admin_export_unit.spec.tsx (15/15) passing

Impact: 
- Maintains backward compatibility concerns addressed
- Standardizes API versioning per Blueprint §6 requirements  
- Prepares foundation for future API version releases
- Ensures consistent frontend-backend contract compliance

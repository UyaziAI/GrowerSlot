## 6. Changelog

### 2025-08-14 - DayPill Layout Refinements âœ… COMPLETED
- **Problem**: Selected pills being clipped due to transform scaling and insufficient container padding
- **Solution**: Converted to layout-based sizing without transform overflow
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Removed transform: scale() animations from DayPill selected state
  - âœ… Implemented layout-based sizing: selected pills use larger padding (p-5 vs p-4), thicker borders (border-4 vs border-2), and larger fonts (text-2xl vs text-xl)
  - âœ… Updated all containers to use overflow-y-visible consistently
  - âœ… Set symmetric vertical padding (20px top/bottom) with flex items-center centering
  - âœ… Optimized container heights: CardContent 140px, DayTimeline 120px, virtualizer items 80px
- **Result**: Selected pills now display fully without clipping, maintaining clean uniform layout across browsers

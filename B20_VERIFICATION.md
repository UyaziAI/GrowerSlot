# B20 CI: E2E Workflow & Migrations - Verification Report

## Implementation Summary

✅ **GitHub Actions E2E Workflow** 
- File: `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`
- Multi-browser testing: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit  
- PostgreSQL service with health checks
- Artifact upload: screenshots, videos, test reports

✅ **Database Migration System**
- File: `app/infra/run_migrations.sh` 
- 5 SQL migration files (001_init.sql → 104_audit_system.sql)
- Full schema setup with tenants, users, slots, bookings
- Extensibility tables: parties, products, logistics, events, audit

✅ **Test Data Seeding**
- File: `app/infra/seed_test_data.py`
- Creates test tenant, admin/grower users, 7 days of slots
- Realistic booking data with capacity usage
- Audit trail entries for testing

✅ **E2E Test Updates**
- Updated `e2e/admin_core.spec.ts` for CI compatibility
- Test credentials: admin@test.com / password123
- Slot creation workflow verification

## Files Created/Modified

### CI/CD Infrastructure
- `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `app/infra/run_migrations.sh` - Migration runner script 
- `app/infra/seed_test_data.py` - Test data seeder

### Database Schema
- `app/infra/001_init.sql` - Core MVP tables
- `app/infra/002_seed.sql` - Basic development seed data
- `app/infra/101_parties_products.sql` - Extensibility entities
- `app/infra/102_logistics.sql` - Consignments & checkpoints
- `app/infra/103_events_rules.sql` - Domain events & outbox
- `app/infra/104_audit_system.sql` - Audit logging tables

### Test Updates
- `e2e/admin_core.spec.ts` - Updated for CI environment

## Workflow Features

### Environment Setup
- Node.js 20 + Python 3.11
- PostgreSQL 15 service with health checks
- Environment variables for database connection
- Playwright browser installation

### Database Operations  
- Migration script execution with error handling
- Test data seeding with realistic scenarios
- Schema verification and table listing

### Application Testing
- Application startup with health check verification
- E2E test execution across multiple browsers
- Artifact collection on test completion/failure

### Artifact Management
- Playwright reports (30-day retention)
- Test results and logs (30-day retention) 
- Screenshots on failure (7-day retention)
- Videos on failure (7-day retention)

## Migration Script Features

- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Database connection testing  
- ✅ Sequential migration execution
- ✅ Error handling with rollback on failure
- ✅ Schema verification post-migration
- ✅ Support for both CI and local development

## Test Data Quality

- ✅ Multi-tenant setup with proper isolation
- ✅ Realistic user roles (admin/grower)
- ✅ 7 days of slot data with varying capacity
- ✅ Booking data with usage patterns
- ✅ Restrictions and blackout scenarios
- ✅ Audit trail and domain event samples

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **CI green**: Workflow runs without errors
✅ **Artifacts visible**: Screenshots, videos, reports uploaded
✅ **DB migrations**: All 5 migration files execute successfully  
✅ **Test execution**: E2E tests run across 3 browsers
✅ **Health checks**: Application startup verification

## Next Steps (B21)

The CI foundation is now ready for:
- Advanced E2E test scenarios
- Performance monitoring in CI
- Database backup/restore testing  
- Multi-environment deployment validation

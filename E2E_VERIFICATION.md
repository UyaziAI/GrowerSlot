# E2E Testing Implementation Verification (B14)

## Overview
Comprehensive Playwright-based end-to-end testing suite for Admin Calendar Core flows has been successfully implemented and configured.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Core Test Scenarios Implemented

#### 1. Bulk Create → slots appear
- **Test**: `e2e/admin_core.spec.ts:45`
- **Coverage**: Dialog opening, form filling, submission, grid refresh verification
- **Data**: Uses dynamic test dates, validates slot creation with capacity and notes

#### 2. Blackout Day → all slots show blackout state  
- **Test**: `e2e/admin_core.spec.ts:86`
- **Coverage**: Pre-creates slots, applies blackout, verifies state changes
- **Validation**: Checks for blackout button feedback and UI state

#### 3. Drag-drop booking moves: success & 409 revert
- **Test**: `e2e/admin_core.spec.ts:116`
- **Coverage**: Booking drag operations, success/error handling, toast validation
- **Error Handling**: Validates both success path and conflict revert scenarios

#### 4. Apply Template: preview → publish → idempotent re-publish
- **Test**: `e2e/admin_core.spec.ts:163`
- **Coverage**: Template selection, preview delta display, publish operations, idempotency verification
- **Feature Flag**: Gated by `VITE_FEATURE_ADMIN_TEMPLATES`

#### 5. Next Available: search → results → jump focuses calendar
- **Test**: `e2e/admin_core.spec.ts:219`
- **Coverage**: Dialog interaction, search form, results display, calendar jump functionality
- **Feature Flag**: Gated by `VITE_FEATURE_NEXT_AVAILABLE`

#### 6. Restrictions UI: scope selection → multi-select → POST
- **Test**: `e2e/admin_core.spec.ts:288`
- **Coverage**: Dialog opening, form validation, grower/cultivar selection, API integration
- **Validation**: Endpoint posting to `/v1/restrictions/apply`

### Additional Test Coverage

#### UI Integration Tests
- **Inspector Panel**: Slot selection, details display, panel interactions
- **View Mode Toggle**: Month/Week/Day switching with state persistence
- **Date Navigation**: Previous/next buttons, today navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and tablet viewport validation

#### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation and error state display
- **Empty States**: Appropriate messaging when no data exists
- **Feature Flag Control**: Proper hiding/showing of gated features

### Technical Implementation

#### Test Infrastructure
- **Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts` with multi-browser support
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Reports**: HTML and JSON output with screenshots on failure

#### CI/CD Integration
- **File**: `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, pull requests
- **Environment**: Ubuntu with browser dependencies
- **Artifacts**: Test reports and failure screenshots (30-day retention)
- **Feature Flags**: Pre-configured for testing all gated features

#### Test Organization
```
e2e/
├── admin_core.spec.ts           # Main test suite (65 test cases)
├── helpers/                     # Shared utilities and page objects
└── fixtures/                    # Test data and mock configurations
```

#### Test Data Strategy
- **Dynamic Dates**: Uses current date + offsets for realistic testing
- **Authentication**: Admin user (`admin@demo.com`) with proper credentials
- **Isolation**: Each test creates its own data to avoid interference
- **Cleanup**: Tests are designed to be idempotent and self-contained

### Quality Assurance

#### Test Case Coverage: 65 Total Tests
- **Core Admin Flows**: 9 critical scenario tests
- **Error Handling**: 2 comprehensive error scenario tests  
- **Responsive Design**: 2 viewport validation tests
- **Cross-Browser**: All tests run on 5 browser configurations
- **Mobile Support**: Dedicated mobile Chrome and Safari testing

#### Verification Methods
- **UI State Validation**: Element visibility, content verification, class assertions
- **API Integration**: Network request interception and response validation
- **User Flow Simulation**: Complete end-to-end user journey testing
- **Feature Flag Control**: Proper gating behavior verification

### Documentation Updates

#### Blueprint.md Section 11 Enhanced
- Added comprehensive E2E testing specification
- Detailed scenario descriptions and technical implementation
- CI integration and cross-browser testing documentation
- Location references and configuration details

#### FEATURES.md Testing Section
- Moved E2E from "Testing Gaps" to "Testing Coverage"
- Marked as ✅ Implemented with full specification
- Updated integration test status to reflect current coverage

### Usage Instructions

#### Local Development
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (requires system dependencies)
npx playwright install

# Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/admin_core.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test --ui

# Run in headed mode to see browser
npx playwright test --headed
```

#### CI Environment
- Tests run automatically on GitHub Actions
- All feature flags enabled for comprehensive testing
- Cross-browser validation ensures compatibility
- Artifacts collected for debugging failed tests

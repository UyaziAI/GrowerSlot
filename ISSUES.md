  - Verify ARIA labels and roles are properly announced
  - Confirm tab order and focus management
  - Test high contrast mode compatibility





### Export endpoint design
- **Severity**: Medium  
- **Description**: Blueprint specifies CSV export endpoint but not implemented
- **Details**: GET /v1/exports/bookings.csv endpoint missing from FastAPI backend
- **Path**: `/app/backend/routers/exports.py`
- **Route**: GET /v1/exports/bookings.csv
- **Status**: Open (Backlog)
- **Impact**: Admin data export functionality unavailable

### Timeline Navigation and Clean Pill Design (August 14, 2025) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Pills cluttered with info icons, lack of month context during horizontal scrolling, suboptimal sizing
- **Root Cause**: Info icons (Ban, AlertCircle, FileText) cluttering pill display, no sticky month reference
- **Resolution**: 
  - Removed all info icons from pills for clean day/date/availability-only display
  - Implemented sticky month header (32px height) with dynamic month updates during scroll
  - Increased pill size to w-[84px] h-[84px] flex-shrink-0 to accommodate longer labels like "155.5"
  - Expanded badge sizes from max-w-[40px] to max-w-[56px] for better label display
  - Reduced rail padding to 8px for snug fit while accommodating sticky header
  - Added accessibility support: aria-live="polite" for month header, screen reader announcements
  - Maintained content overflow protection and visual-only selection highlighting
  - Enhanced centering with scrollIntoView({ inline: 'center' }) and focus() for accessibility
  - Final container dimensions: ITEM_TRACK (98px), RAIL_MIN_HEIGHT (114px), total height (146px)
- **Status**: Clean pill design with sticky month header navigation context achieved

### DayTimeline Initial Load & Interaction (August 14, 2025) - RESOLVED  
- **Issue**: Timeline centering failed for initial load, Today button, and Jump-to-date functionality
- **Root Cause**: Virtualizer scroll element binding mismatch causing getOffsetForIndex tuple handling issues
- **Resolution**: 
  - Fixed virtualizer.scrollToIndex implementation with proper scroll element binding
  - Resolved getOffsetForIndex tuple return value extraction
  - Eliminated nested scroll containers interfering with calculations
  - Added comprehensive debugging for scroll positioning verification
- **Status**: Timeline now centers reliably on all centering operations

### Week Overview UX (August 14, 2025) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Week view used hourly time grid instead of day card overview per Blueprint Section 7
- **Resolution**: Implemented WeekOverviewGrid and DayCard components replacing time grid layout
- **Features**: 7 day cards with availability summaries, click-to-navigate, responsive design
- **Compliance**: Blueprint Section 7 UX plan fully implemented with proper navigation flow

## Resolved Issues âœ…

### Repository Audit & API Migration (August 14, 2025) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Frontend query keys using `/api/` prefix, legacy files present, TypeScript errors
- **Resolution**:
  - Updated all query keys to use resource names: `["slots"]`, `["bookings"]`, etc.
  - Added tenantId scoping to query keys for proper multi-tenant caching  
  - Fixed useSlotsRange hook to use `/v1/slots/range` endpoint
  - Removed legacy files (admin-dashboard-old.tsx, grower-dashboard-old.tsx)
  - Fixed TypeScript type conversion issues
- **Verification**: All LSP diagnostics cleared, API contracts match Blueprint.md
- **Documentation**: Created SCAN_REPORT.md and VERIFICATION_REPORT.md

### Timeline Pill Vertical Clipping (August 14, 2025) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Selected day pills were being cut off at top/bottom due to CSS transform scaling
- **Root Cause**: Using transform: scale() caused pills to extend beyond container bounds
- **Resolution**: 
  - Removed transform scale animations from DayPill component
  - Implemented layout-based sizing using larger padding for selected pills (p-5 vs p-4)
  - Increased font sizes for selected pills (text-2xl vs text-xl)
  - Optimized container height to 120px with symmetric 16px vertical padding
  - Maintained overflow-y-visible throughout container hierarchy
- **Compliance**: Followed strict requirements for clean layout without transform overflow artifacts
- **Status**: Pills now properly centered and never clipped, maintaining professional appearance

### LSP Diagnostics (August 14, 2025) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Multiple TypeScript/Python LSP errors in backend and calendar features
- **Resolution**: All TypeScript imports and calendar implementation working correctly
- **Verification**: LSP diagnostics show no current errors, Day/Week toggle functional

### Authentication Flow (August 13, 2025)
- **Issue**: JWT authentication headers not properly included in API requests
- **Resolution**: Fixed in `/client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` with proper token inclusion
- **Verification**: Login working for both admin and grower users

### Database Schema Consistency (August 13, 2025)  
- **Issue**: TypeScript type errors due to timestamptz vs timestamp inconsistency
- **Resolution**: Updated schema definitions to use consistent timestamp types
- **Verification**: No more TypeScript compilation errors in core schema

### Booking Concurrency (August 13, 2025)
- **Issue**: Risk of overbooking without proper concurrency controls
- **Resolution**: Implemented SELECT FOR UPDATE pattern in booking endpoint
- **Verification**: Tested with concurrent requests, proper 409 responses

### Calendar Day/Week Toggle (August 14, 2025) - RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Week view button missing, only Day button visible in calendar interface
- **Resolution**: Enabled Week view by setting isWeekViewEnabled = true across all calendar pages
- **Implementation**: Week view displays 7-day grid with time-axis layout, proper date navigation
- **Verification**: Both Day and Week buttons visible and functional, grid switches correctly
- **Compliance**: Blueprint MVP requirement (Sections 1.3, 7, 12) for Day/Week views fulfilled

## Technical Debt ðŸ“‹

### Dual Backend Architecture
- **Description**: Running both Node.js (legacy) and FastAPI (blueprint) backends
- **Impact**: Increased complexity, potential confusion
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Solution**: Gradual migration or clear separation of responsibilities
- **Timeline**: Evaluate after Phase 1 completion

### Migration Strategy  
- **Description**: Manual migration files need integration with development workflow
- **Impact**: Risk of inconsistent database states across environments
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Solution**: Automated migration runner integration with CI/CD

### Frontend Module Structure
- **Description**: New feature modules not fully integrated with existing app structure
- **Impact**: Some blueprint features not accessible via navigation
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Solution**: Update routing and navigation to include logistics/quality modules

## Rule Violations ðŸš¨

### Documentation Lag (Resolved - August 13, 2025)
- **Rule**: Section 2 - Always update BLUEPRINT.md when adding features
- **Violation**: Initial FastAPI implementation done without immediate doc updates
- **Resolution**: BLUEPRINT.md confirmed current, FEATURES.md created
- **Prevention**: This tracking system now in place

### Testing Coverage Gap
- **Rule**: Section 6 - Implement tests for new functionality  
- **Violation**: New FastAPI endpoints lack comprehensive test coverage
- **Status**: Acknowledged technical debt
